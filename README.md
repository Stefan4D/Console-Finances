# Console Finances

## Description

Submission for Module 4 of the University of Birmingham Skills Bootcamp in Front-End Web Development &amp; UX.

This assignment took a starter code package in commit [5d978e9](https://github.com/Stefan4D/Console-Finances/commit/5d978e93b0a4541e0999f1c1513cb21bba09b2a1) and developed it to meet the defined acceptance criteria.

The production website is deployed [here](https://stefan4d.github.io/Console-Finances/).

| Write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:<br>1. The total number of months included in the dataset.<br>2. The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.<br>3. The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.<br>4. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.<br>5. The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period. | Solution is detailed within `index.js` as comments including solution steps for more complicated logic. |

## Learning Outcome

- I learned the .toFixed() method for rounding numbers to a specific number of decimal places, as opposed to round(), floor(), or ceil() which round to integers.

- I practiced DOM manipulation by also inserting the calculated results into the main HTML document.

## Resources Used

In completing this challenge exercise, I made use of the following resources:

- [MDN Docs: Number .toFixed()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixed)
